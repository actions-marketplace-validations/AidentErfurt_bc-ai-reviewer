# Aident Business Central AI Code Reviewer

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

Run an AI-powered, Business Central-specific code review on pull requests. This repository provides a GitHub composite action that:

- Collects the PR unified diff and optional context files (app.json, permission sets, markdowns, linked issues).
- Sends a structured prompt to your chosen LLM provider (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, OpenRouter.ai).
- Posts a summary review and fine-grained inline comments on the PR.

## Why this is Business Central–specific

This action is not a generic code reviewer. It is tailored for Business Central AL projects:

- It only reviews AL and BC app artifacts (`**/*.al`, `app.json`, permission sets, markdown docs) and builds deterministic BC object metadata from the HEAD version of your files.
- The review prompt is grounded in AL Guidelines [ALGuidelines.dev](https://alguidelines.dev/) and standard BC design patterns (event-driven extensibility, AL-Go structure, upgrade codeunits, etc.).
- Feedback is BC domain-aware: posting routines, journals, ledgers, dimensions, VAT/currencies, inventory costing, approvals, permissions, data classification, AppSource vs. Per-Tenant rules, and SaaS/multi-tenant safety are all first-class concerns.
- The reviewer prefers safe, upgrade-friendly, tenant-aware suggestions over "clever" but risky shortcuts, and explicitly calls out high-risk changes (posting, schema/upgrade, security/permissions, public APIs/events).

Combined with the [`.continue/prompts/review-pr.md`](.continue/prompts/review-pr.md) prompt and [`PR Reviewer Rules`](.continue/rules/pr-reviewer.md), this makes the review behavior strongly aligned with real-world BC AL practices rather than a generic LLM code review.

## Highlights
- Opinionated defaults and rules are bundled in the action (default-config.yaml) for sensible behaviour out of the box.
- MODELS_BLOCK enables flexible model/provider selection (OpenAI, Azure Foundry, OpenRouter, ...).

## Quick concepts
- MODELS_BLOCK (required): a multiline YAML string containing a `models:` array. It fully replaces the embedded `models:` section in default-config.yaml.
- Merged config: the action writes a merged YAML to `$RUNNER_TEMP/continue-config.yaml` and sets `CONTINUE_CONFIG` to that path before invoking the review scripts.
- Secrets: supply via `secrets.*` (interpolate directly in MODELS_BLOCK) or use placeholders like `apiKey: "{{AZURE_OPENAI_KEY}}"` and set corresponding env vars in the workflow.

## Example workflow

```yaml

Note: The review can be re-triggered by commenting `/review` on the pull request (issue_comment event).

## Composite Action Inputs

These inputs are defined in action.yml (defaults in parentheses).

| Input | Type | Default | Description |
|---|:---:|---:|---|
| GITHUB_TOKEN | string | required | GitHub token with repo scope. Defaults to `github.token` when not passed explicitly. |
| MODELS_BLOCK | string (YAML) | required | Multiline YAML that fully replaces the default `models:` section. |
| APPROVE_REVIEWS | boolean | false | When true, the bot uses the model’s `suggestedAction` to choose APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT for the summary review. |
| MAX_COMMENTS | number | 10 | Maximum inline comments to post (0 = unlimited; GitHub caps at 1000 per PR). |
| PROJECT_CONTEXT | string | "" | Optional architecture / guidelines text injected into the prompt. |
| CONTEXT_FILES | string | "" | Comma-separated globs for extra context files (read from HEAD). |
| INCLUDE_PATTERNS | string | "**/*.al" | Comma-separated globs to include in review. |
| EXCLUDE_PATTERNS | string | "" | Comma-separated globs to exclude from review. |
| ISSUE_COUNT | number | 0 | Max linked issues to fetch (0 = all). |
| FETCH_CLOSED_ISSUES | boolean | true | Include closed issues as context. |
| AUTO_DETECT_APPS | boolean | true | Discover app.json for changed files. |
| INCLUDE_APP_PERMISSIONS | boolean | true | Include `*.PermissionSet.al` and `*.Entitlement.al` for each relevant app. |
| INCLUDE_APP_MARKDOWN | boolean | true | Include `*.md` for each relevant app. |
| BASE_PROMPT_EXTRA | string | "" | Free-form text appended to the base review prompt. |
| DEBUG_PAYLOAD | boolean | false | When true, prints the JSON payload to logs (use sparingly; can be large). |
| SNIPPET_CONTEXT_LINES | number | 12 | Lines of context around each changed line in numbered snippets. |


## Runtime behavior (what the action does)

- Installs Node.js v20, `parse-diff`, and the [Continue CLI](https://docs.continue.dev/guides/cli); optionally installs `uv` for MCP integration.
- Merges continue [MODELS_BLOCK](https://docs.continue.dev/reference#models) into the bundled default-config.yaml at runtime via `.github/actions/continue/merge-config.ps1`, writes the merged file to `$RUNNER_TEMP`, and sets `CONTINUE_CONFIG`.
- Executes `scripts/continue-review.ps1` which:
  - Fetches the PR unified diff and parses it with `scripts/parse-diff.js`.
  - Filters changed files by INCLUDE_PATTERNS/EXCLUDE_PATTERNS.
  - Builds numbered snippets with SNIPPET_CONTEXT_LINES of surrounding context.
  - Optionally auto-discovers app.json and includes permissions and markdown files.
  - Assembles a structured prompt and invokes Continue CLI with `.continue/prompts/review-pr.md`.
  - Posts a summary review and up to MAX_COMMENTS inline comments. If APPROVE_REVIEWS is true, uses the model’s `suggestedAction` for the summary event.

## Troubleshooting & tips

- If the reviewer prints errors about `CONTINUE_CONFIG` being invalid, ensure the action sets it to the merged config path (the composite action does this automatically).
- If the model returns non-JSON or malformed JSON, the scripts attempt sanitisation and retries; inspect the uploaded CLI logs (artifact `.continue-logs/`) for raw provider output.
- Never commit real API keys or secrets. Use GitHub Secrets. The merged config is written to `$RUNNER_TEMP` and is not committed.

## Where things live in this repo

- `action.yml` — composite action entry point (wires steps and inputs).
- `scripts/continue-review.ps1` — runner script that builds the prompt, calls the Continue CLI and posts GitHub reviews.
- `.github/actions/continue/default-config.yaml` — bundled template used when merging models.
- `.github/actions/continue/merge-config.ps1` — runtime merge helper (replaces `models:` and substitutes placeholders).
- `scripts/parse-diff.js` — diff parsing helper used by the runner.
